## Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

The master of shortcuts begins with the obvious.<br/>
What is prime is shown plainly.<br/>
What is deeper, waits quietly inside the dropdowns.<br/>

### App Management

- **Cmd + Q** – Quit the current app
  <div class="extra-info">Unlike Windows, closing the window with the red button doesn’t quit the app – it just hides it. Use Cmd+Q to actually free memory and quit fully. The tiny dot underneath the icon on the dock indicates whether the app is still running.</div>

- **Cmd + W** – Close current window/tab
  <div class="extra-info">The app stays running in the background. Great for closing docs or browser tabs without exiting the entire app.</div>

- **Cmd + H** – Hide app and all windows
  <div class="extra-info">Useful for clearing clutter without minimizing every window. Hides instantly; reappear with Cmd+Tab or clicking Dock icon.</div>

- **Cmd + M** – Minimize current window
  <div class="extra-info">Sends the window to the Dock’s right side. Unlike Cmd+H, it’s per-window rather than per-app.</div>

- **Cmd + Tab** – Switch apps
  <div class="extra-info">Cycles between open applications. Doesn’t show minimized apps unless you click them in the Dock first.</div>

- **Cmd + `** – Cycle through windows of same app
  <div class="extra-info">Incredibly helpful when juggling multiple documents in the same program (e.g., Word, Finder, etc).</div>

### Screenshots & Clipboard

- **Cmd + Shift + 3** – Full-screen screenshot
- **Cmd + Shift + 4** – Select area screenshot
- **Cmd + Shift + 5** – Screenshot/video tool UI
  <div class="extra-info">By default, screenshots are saved to Desktop. To copy instead of save, hold **Ctrl** while using the shortcut (e.g. Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+4). You can also change the default to clipboard in the Cmd+Shift+5 menu > Options.</div>

### Finder & Files

- **Cmd + Space** – Spotlight search
- **Cmd + Delete** – Move selected file to Trash
- **Option + Cmd + V** – Move copied file (cut-paste)
  <div class="extra-info">Unlike Windows, Cmd+X doesn't cut files in Finder. Use Cmd+C then Option+Cmd+V to move.</div>

- **Spacebar** – Quick Look preview
  <div class="extra-info">Preview images, PDFs, videos, etc., without opening an app. Tap again to close preview.</div>

### Misc Essentials

- **Cmd + ,** – Open preferences of current app
- **Option + Cmd + Esc** – Force Quit dialog
- **Ctrl + Cmd + Q** – Lock screen instantly
  <div class="extra-info">Think of it as macOS's version of Win+L.</div>

- **Fn (Globe)** – Can trigger dictation or input switching
  <div class="extra-info">Customizable in System Settings. Defaults to dictation when pressed twice.</div>

  <div class="extra-info">Siri is Apple's answer to Clippy. Most users never miss it.</div>
- **Enable Path Bar and Status Bar in Finder: View menu → Show Path Bar, Show Status Bar**
- **Change scroll direction: System Settings → Trackpad → Uncheck "Scroll direction: Natural"**
  <div class="extra-info">If scrolling feels backwards, this is why.</div>

## Managing Windows Like a Pro

In the beginning, all paths seem crooked, yet<br/>
they lead to the same mountain.

The wise user knows:
confusion is the first teacher,<br/>
simplicity hides within complexity,<br/>
and what feels strange becomes familiar<br/>
repetition, repetition, repetition.


**Tip:** Explore System Settings. Search is your friend. Most annoyances have a checkbox.

The path reveals itself<br/>
to those who use the search.<br/>
Ask the machine,<br/>
then ask the friend who has walked before—<br/><br/>
David has made all the mistakes.
